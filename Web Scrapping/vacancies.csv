Вони виявляють баги у залізі, софті або взаємодіях систем. Це не просто команда «клікерів», це творчі інженери. Вони перевіряють нові пристрої в різних екстремальних умовах: імітують рухи людей і тварин, відтворюють складні погодні умови, перепади температур, влаштовують контрольовані пожежі та затоплення.<br><br>Ми будуємо невеликі команди та створюємо такі умови, щоб робочий час ішов безпосередньо на дослідження й розробку замість нескінченних зустрічей і обговорень. <br>Для нас ідеї та рішення важливіші за титули, тому ми не використовуємо класичні айтішні ґрейди — Senior/Middle/Junior.<br><br>У нас багато пропрієтарних технологій.
